# Baseball-Linear-Regression
Using linear regression to predicts wins.

### About
Linear Regression is a statistical method that measures the relationship between variables. to predict an dependent variable (in this case: Runs) with use of a number of independent variable.
Success of the project will be seen as how small the Root Mean Square Error (RSME) is. This indicates how many wins the prediction was off by the actual number of wins.

### Process

### Improvement
- Team Placement: 

    The next steps I could take is to consider which teams are in certain leagues or divisions as this can be a biggest 
    difference of a teams Win-Loss Record. Some instances can include how good the other teams in divisions are as teams are 
    scheduled to play teams in their respective division more than certains that are not in their division or league 
    
    
- Ballpark Dimensions:
    
    If a ballpark has short dimensions, this can be a huge factor in creating more home runs and higher E.R.A for certain teams 
    e.g the New York Yankees(Yankee Stadium), Toronto Blue Jays(Rogers Center).Or viceversa in ballpark with bigger dimensions 
    such as Oakland Athletics (Oakland Coliseum), Pittsbrugh Pirates(PNC Park)
    
    
- Weather:
   
    It can affect the travel distance of the ball. If cold, then the ball won't travel as much and may cause positive skew in a team's statsline. Viceversa for when weather is    
    hot. I also would need to look weather metrics that are considered to be cold or hot.
    
- Variables:
    I can consider the correlations of the variables on which ones are suited best for Games_Won  
    
- Model:
    Figure out a way to get the 2015 Blue Jays RSME much lower.
